# Python Decorators

A collection of Python decorators demonstrating their use in modifying function behavior. This repository includes various examples such as logging, performance tracking, and more. It showcases how decorators can enhance code readability, reusability, and maintainability.

## Features

- **Logging Decorators**: Track function calls and arguments for debugging.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure the execution time of functions.
- **Authorization**: Implement basic authentication checks in functions.
- **Reusable Code**: Demonstrates how decorators can be applied to various scenarios for cleaner and more modular code.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PunitTak2005/Decorators-in-python.git
    ```
2. Browse through the example decorators in the `decorators.py` file.
3. Apply decorators to your functions by simply using the `@decorator_name` syntax.

### Example

```python
@my_decorator
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

greet()
